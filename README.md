# php-ios
php 7.4.6 compiled for newer iOS/devices 

iOS13 arch64 compiled php cli since i couldn't find one anywhere..you can go ahead and grab the binary (already signed/entitled) or compile yourself with the sh script

jailbreak required obviously..just drop php in /usr/bin and enjoy using php on your iphone
